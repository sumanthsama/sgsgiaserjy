        <h2>History of S.G.S. Government Institute of Advanced Study in Education</h2>
        <h3>The Genesis: Foundation of Excellence (1853 - 1883)</h3>

        <div class="timeline">
            <div class="event">
                
                <p>The history of S.G.S. Government Institute of Advanced Study in Education (S.G.S. G.I.A.S.E.) dates back to 1853, when the Mission Framing School was established in Madras under the Madras Education Department. This marked the beginning of a structured approach to teacher education in the region. The institution began with the vision to train teachers and strengthen the education system in the Madras Presidency.

                    In 1883, the foundation stone for teacher education in Rajahmundry was laid with the establishment of the Local Fund Elementary Normal School, which catered to the training of teachers for elementary education.</p>

            <div class="event">
                <h2>Milestone Achievements Over the Decades</h2>
                <h3>1887: Upgradation to Secondary Normal School</h3>
                <p>To meet the growing demand for trained educators, the Elementary Normal School was upgraded to a Secondary Normal School. This upgrade allowed the institution to extend its focus to training teachers for secondary-level education, marking a significant step forward in its journey of educational empowerment.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="event">
                <h3>1894: Establishment of Government Training College</h3>
                <p>In 1894, the institution became known as the Government Training College in Rajahmundry. It began offering the Licentiate in Teaching (L.T.) course, positioning the institution as a hub for advanced teacher education in the region.
                    <ul>

                   <li>Key Contributors: Visionaries such as Dr. Duncan and Honâ€™ble Mr. Raghunadha Rao played crucial roles in the development of the institution during this period.</p>
                    </div>

            <div class="event">
                <h3>1928: Replacement of L.T. Course with B.Ed Program</h3>
                <p>As part of an ongoing effort to elevate the quality of teacher education, the L.T. course was replaced by the Bachelor of Education (B.Ed) program. This transition enabled the institution to align with modern educational standards and better prepare teachers for the evolving classroom needs</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="event">

            <div class="event">
                <h3>1959: Transformation into G.I.A.S.E.</h3>
                <p>Following the recommendations of the Kothari Commission, the institution was elevated to the status of Government Institute of Advanced Study in Education (G.I.A.S.E.) in 1959. This transformation reflected the institute's broadened mission, including:</p>
